My game is called THE FOX AND THE FALLING BOX. You start out in the middle of a level, where you can chose to go left or right. You encounter purple blocks which, when touched, fall after 3 seconds, then respawn 3 seconds later. The Fox shoots angry thoughts out the top of it's head, which cause the enemy frogs to jump from shock. The player aims with the mouse. Once all 3 door parts (which are scattered accross the map) are collect, the player may go through the big door, and earn a sweet victory. Overall, I got almost everything I set out to do in the design. Gravity is done using bolt!
